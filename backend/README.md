# LatentLens backend

A real FastAPI service behind the **same `AgentEvent` SSE protocol** the Vue
frontend already speaks — a drop-in replacement for the Node mock on `:8787`.

The orchestration is a **LangGraph** plan-and-execute `StateGraph` with the
plan-approval and per-step approval gates as first-class `interrupt()`s. Analysis
runs over **MCP** tools (FastMCP, connected in-process). The work is real: numpy
profiling, PCA (SVD) + k-means over a 50k-row synthetic dataset *or your uploaded
CSV/Parquet*, an LLM-generated plan, and an LLM-generated summary card — each with
a deterministic offline fallback so it runs fully without a key. The LLM is
**provider-agnostic** (Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini / any OpenAI-compatible
endpoint) — see [`app/providers.py`](app/providers.py).

See [`app/orchestrator.py`](app/orchestrator.py) for the graph and the SSE bridge;
[`../README.md`](../README.md) for the whole-project writeup.

## Setup

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# optional: enable live generation (planner + summaries) with ANY provider.
# Without a key the app uses deterministic fallbacks and still runs fully.
cp .env.example .env      # then add ONE provider key (see below)
```

`.env` is gitignored — each tester supplies their own key. Set exactly one of
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` and the provider is
auto-detected; override with `LLM_PROVIDER` / `LLM_MODEL` / `LLM_BASE_URL`. A
`LLM_BASE_URL` points the OpenAI-compatible adapter at Azure / Groq / OpenRouter /
Mistral / DeepSeek / Ollama / a local model. SDKs are lazy-imported, so you only
need the one for your chosen provider. (If a key's account is unfunded or the
model id is wrong, the call fails and the app falls back — no crash.)

## Run

```bash
# backend alone (:8787)
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8787

# backend + Vite together (from frontend/)
cd ../frontend && npm run dev:api      # → http://localhost:5173
```

The Vite proxy already targets `:8787`, so this swaps cleanly with `npm run dev:all`
(the Node mock). Verify in a browser with `npm run verify:browser`.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/api/runs` | start a run → `text/event-stream` (held at plan + approval gates) |
| `POST` | `/api/runs/:id/plan` | resume with the edited plan `{ steps: [{ id }] }` |
| `POST` | `/api/runs/:id/decision` | resolve a gate `{ stepId, decision }` |
| `GET`  | `/api/runs/:id/stream?after=N` | reconnect to a dropped run → replay frames after seq `N`, then follow live |
| `POST` | `/api/runs/:id/cancel` | intentional stop — tear the run down server-side |
| `POST` | `/api/datasets` | upload a CSV/Parquet → parse + profile → `{ datasetId, delimiter, hasHeader, columns[], … }` schema for the preview/confirm step |
| `GET`  | `/api/points?ref&n` | binary `Float32` cloud `[x, y, cluster] * n` |
| `GET`  | `/health` | `{ status, version, activeRuns }` |

## Resilient streaming

A run's execution is **decoupled from any one HTTP connection**: `POST /api/runs`
spawns a background task that drives the LangGraph graph and appends each
AgentEvent to a per-run, `id:`-sequenced buffer; the HTTP response just
*subscribes* (replay-then-follow). So:

- **Heartbeats** — a subscriber emits an SSE comment (`: hb`) whenever the buffer
  is idle, keeping a connection held at a gate alive past proxy/browser idle
  timeouts.
- **Resume-by-runId** — if the stream drops, the client reconnects to
  `GET /api/runs/:id/stream?after=<last seq>` and the server replays exactly what
  was missed (contiguous, no gaps, no dupes) then follows live — even frames the
  run produced while *no one* was connected. The frontend transport does this
  automatically with backoff.
- **Bounded** — an unanswered gate times out (`LATENTLENS_GATE_TTL_S`, default
  600s) and a finished run's buffer is reaped after `LATENTLENS_RESUME_TTL_S`
  (default 60s), so abandoned runs can't leak.

(The Node mock streams the same protocol and adds the heartbeats; the resumable
buffer is a real-backend feature — the mock 404s `/stream`, which the client
treats as "run gone, stop retrying".)

## Real vs. wired

- **Real now:** the synthetic dataset (latent segments) *or your uploaded
  CSV/Parquet* flows through MCP tools — `profile_dataset` (counts, missingness,
  duplicates) → `reduce_dimensions` (PCA via SVD + k-means, served by ref) →
  `cluster_segments` (sizes). Tool-call args/results reflect actual numbers (e.g.
  imputed cell count = missing-fraction × rows). Uploaded CSVs have their
  delimiter (`, ; \t |`) and header presence **auto-detected** (`app/datasets.py`,
  via `csv.Sniffer` + heuristic fallbacks; headerless files get `col1…colN`); the
  parsed schema is returned for a client-side preview-and-confirm before any run.
- **Real explanations:** the lasso "explain these points" follow-up maps the
  selected embedding points back to their dataset rows and z-scores each numeric
  feature's selection mean against the population — over a real MCP tool,
  `selection_feature_stats`. So the answer is grounded in *what distinguishes the
  region* (top features by |z|), surfaced as a `feature_delta` UI intent; the LLM
  only writes prose around those computed numbers.
- **Real delegation:** the `clean`/`cluster` steps delegate to specialist
  sub-agents that invoke *fine-grained* MCP tools for real — the cleaning-agent
  calls `impute_missing`/`drop_duplicates`/`standardize_columns`, the
  segmentation-agent calls `run_kmeans`/`label_segments`. The delegation trace is
  those genuine calls (real args, real results), not an illustrative mock-up, and
  their returns ARE the step's result.
- **LLM (wired, any provider, needs a key):** `generate_plan` decomposes the goal
  into an ordered plan (enum-constrained to the step catalog), and **every
  `summary_card`** — profiling, cleaning, clustering, the final segment summary,
  and the lasso "explain" follow-up — has its prose written by the model under the
  provider's **structured outputs** (the "constrained generation surface" made
  real; stat tiles and the embedding stay pure data). The provider is pluggable —
  Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`app/providers.py`);
  each output is re-validated with `jsonschema`. Without a key (or on any error —
  rate limit, unfunded account, wrong model id) each card falls back to a
  deterministic template, so the pipeline runs fully offline.
- **Approval-gate estimate (real):** the gate's rows/time are computed from the
  actual dataset; the cost is a model-aware estimate of the run's LLM spend
  (`app/pricing.py`) — the heavy compute is local numpy ($0), so the real cost is
  the planner + card generation calls in the approved plan. Offline → `$0.00 (local)`.

## Next (not yet built)

Durable persistence — swap `MemorySaver` → a Postgres/SQLite LangGraph
checkpointer + a shared run buffer (e.g. Redis) + object-store embeddings, so
resume survives a process restart or multiple workers (a config swap now that
LangGraph owns the orchestration and the buffer is already abstracted).
